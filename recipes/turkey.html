    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This turkey recipe uses orange wedges and aromatics to add flavor, while a champagne broth works its magic to keep the turkey moist and tender. My grandmother and mother passed this recipe on to me. It changes a little every Thanksgiving, because I've never written the recipe down before. But the roast turkey is always incredibly juicy and succulent!</p>
